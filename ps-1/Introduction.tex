\section{Goals, Background and Plans after Graduation}

My primary goals for this course are to 
\begin{itemize}
	\item develop a healthy and productive relationship with coding as I do not particularly enjoy programming currently
	 
	\item  get better at it 
	
\end{itemize}
I took a computational math course in my second year of undergraduate studies at the University of Ghana. I also had my final year project in the area of Density Functional Theory to determine the structural and electronic properties of Potassium Niobate ($KNbO_{3}$) with first principles which included quite a lot of coding. I quickly realized I needed more practice in this area so I was an intern at Ghana Space Science and Technology Institute after graduation where I worked on a project entitled 'Classification of Galaxies using Convolutional Neural Network Techniques'. After my Master's, I plan on furthering my education and enrolling in a PhD programme related to Fusion Energy.\\
